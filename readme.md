# CSS Feature Toggle Extension

This devtools extension provides the ability to toggle-off CSS features, allowing developers to see how their pages and applications render and fallback in browsers that don't support modern CSS features.

Available for Chrome via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-feature-toggles/aeinmfddnniiloadoappmdnffcbffnjg).

## Supported browsers

* Chrome â€” installable via [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-feature-toggles/aeinmfddnniiloadoappmdnffcbffnjg)
* Opera

This extension uses devtools API features that aren't supported in Firefox yet:

  * `devtools.inspectedWindow.getResources()`
  * `devtools.inspectedWindow.onResourceAdded`
  * `resource.getContent()`
  * `resource.setContent()`

## Limitations

Toggling CSS features isn't supported everywhere *yet* so you should be aware of these caveats:

* Inline styles (`<div style="...">`) will not be disabled.
* Changes made to a stylesheet via the CSSOM will not be disabled.

## How it works

The extension uses `browser.devtools.inpectedWindow.getResources()` to fetch the content of stylesheet and document resources loaded in the current window. For stylesheet resources, `resource.getContent()` is used to extract the style content. For document resources, a script is injected into the document which extracts the CSS content from `<style>` elements.

Extracted style content is passed through a series of regular expressions that rename the feature property/value/identifiers. The original content is then replaced with the modified CSS using either `resource.setContent`, for stylesheets or - for document styles - by injecteding a script to update the relevant `<style>` elements. For example:

* `display: flex` becomes `display: -disabled-flex`
* `@supports (...) {}` becomes `@-disabled-supports (...) {}`
* `transform: ...` becomes `@-disabled-transform: ... {}`
* `width: calc(...)` becomes `width: -disabled-calc(...)`
